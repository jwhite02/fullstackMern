        "Directions": "<h2 class=\"theDir\">The Directions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Crust: Make your Graham cracker cookie crumbs by using a food processor or simply place in a plastic bag and crush using a rolling pin.  Mix Graham Crackers, melted butter, sugar and vanilla extract in a bowl.  Spread in the bottom of a 9\" springform pan and up 1 1\/2 inch on the side.  Place in freezer to harden. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>For the Filling: Preheat Oven at 350&deg;F.  Using an electric mixer blend cream cheese on low speed in a mixing bowl.  Use spatula to scrape sides and paddle of mixer.  Add in the sugar and molasses slowly, and continue to beat until creamy.  Add in vanilla extract, lemon juice and cinnamon and mix until blended.  Add in eggs one at a time and continue to mix a lowest speed until eggs are incorporated in the batter.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Pour the mixture into your crust and use offset spatula to help scoop out the batter.  Bake for hour or until center jiggles and the top is slightly brown.  Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack. <\/p>\n\n\n<p> For the Topping: Using a food processor, puree your apples. \nIn a large sauce pan, heat jelly, apricot preserves and corn syrup stirring until melted.  Mix in apple puree.  In a smal cup, dissolve corn starch in the cold water, then whisk into the glaze.  Bring to a simmer and cook until mixture boils, thickens and turns clear- ~ 2 minutes.  Strain the glaze and drizzle over entire cheesecake.  As as side note: Sprinkling chopped almonds on top of glaze also adds a nice touch.  Cover pan with plastic making sure not to touch the glaze.  Refigerate until cheesecake and glaze has set.  Serve and enjoy your Apple Pie Cheesecake. <\/p>\n\n",
