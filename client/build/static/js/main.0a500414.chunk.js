Remove paper and chill until frosting is firm, about one hour.</p>\n<p>Spoon Raspberry Grand-Marnier Sauce into the center and garnish with fresh raspberries.</p>\n<p>White Chocolate Frosting: Place whipping cream in a small bowl and gently heat. Add white chocolate to cream and stir until melted. Cool to room temperature.</p>\n<p>With electric mixer beat cream cheese and lemon zest together. Add white chocolate and cream; whip until smooth. If frosting is too soft, refrigerate until it is thick and creamy.</p>\n<p>Raspberry-Grand Marnier Sauce: In a saucepan, heat berries until just warm, and juice is released. If using fresh berries, add 1/4 cup water. Force the mixture thru a sieve or juicer. Return juice to saucepan; discard solids. Add sugar to taste. If using fresh berries 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar should be adequate. If using pre-sweetened berries, little or no additional sugar may be needed. Cook over medium high heat until liquid is reduced by half. Remove from heat, add orange liqueur and cool.</p>\n<p>* NOTE: White confectionery products with cocoa butter as an ingredient are generally referred to as white chocolate. The term 'white chocolate' is a misnomer, however, as chocolate refers to the brown chocolate liqueur found when processing the cocoa beans. Look for cocoa butter listed as the first ingredient on the package, as the higher the ratio of cocoa butter in the product, the finer the confection. If cocoa butter is not listed as an ingredient, the product is a white compound or confectioner's coating. White chocolate should be handled carefully. it should not be over heated. In this recipe, the cream should be just barely warm enough to gently melt the chocolate. If the chocolate gets too warm, it may 'seize' and refuse to melt.</p>\n",URITag:"white-chocolate-hazelnut-raspberry-cheesecake",id:"chocolate49",category:"ChocolateCheesecakeRecipes"},{Title:"Mini Chocolate Cheesecakes",Content:"Hope you enjoy your Mini Chocolate Cheesecakes.",META:'<META Name="Description" Content="Mini Chocolate Cheesecakes will have you craving even more delicious cheesecakes recipes.Mm Mm Good.">\n<META Name="Keywords" Content="Mini Chocolate Cheesecakes,cheesecake,cheesecake recipe,dessert">\n',Ingredients:"\n<li>Graham Crumb Shells</li>\n<li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>\n<li>1/3 cup Hershey's Semi-Sweet Chocolate Mini Chips</li>\n<li>1 egg</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>\n<li>Graham Crumb Shells</li>\n<li>1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>\n",Directions:'<h2 class="theDir">The Directions:</h2>\n\n\n<p>Prepare Graham Crumb Shells; set aside.</p>\n<p>Soften cream cheese in small mixer bowl; beat in sugar.
